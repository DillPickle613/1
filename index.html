                    <h2>Info About Our Cause</h2>
                    <p>Organ Trafficking in China is a multi-million dollar business. Although it might generate lots of money for China, it is extremely cruel and harmful to everyone. Every year, China illegally carries out over 60,000 organ transplants. Most of these come from people who don't agree with China's political stance, or religion. These people are killed based on their beliefs and executed by the government and used for illegal organ transplants.</p>
                    <p>China is showing no signs of stopping this cruel practice on innocent people. They have made up false claims stating that they don't use this practice anymore, but this is highly controversial.The Chinese have recently been under fire by the Vatican by providing no evidence that they don't use this practice anymore. They only used a two slide presentation to display their cause, and many people believe that it's not enough.</p>
