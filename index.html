                        <p>Organ Trafficking in China is a multi-<em>million</em> dollar busniness. Although it might generate lots of money for China, it is exremely cruel and harmful to everyone. Every year, China illegaly carries out over 60,000 organ transplants. Most of these come from people who dont agree with China's political stance, or religon. These people are killed based on their beleifs and executed by the government and used for illegal organ transplants.</p>
                        <p>China is showing no signs of stopping this cruel practice on innocent people. They have made up claims stating that they don't use this practice anymore. But many people dissagree with this claim. Recently, at a conference in the Vatican, Chinese officals decided to unambigously refuse to state weather they still use this practice or not. Plus, the Chinese officals have reportedly onlyused a 2 slide powerpoint to show that they dont use it anymore. Many people agree that they arent too convincing in telling people that they dont use this practice anymore.</p>
