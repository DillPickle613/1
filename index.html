          <h1>General Information</h1>
          <p>Organ trafficking is defined as illegal harvest, transport, and/or use of human organs. In China, it is a billion dollar industry.  Although it generates a profit for the Chinese government, it is extremely cruel and harmful. Each year, Chinese hospitals illegally perform over 60,000 organ transplants. Most of the organs used are taken from those not aligned with the Chinese governmentâ€™s political or religious ideals. People such as those who follow Falun Gong are targeted based on their beliefs, and executed by the government in order to replenish the supply of organs for transplant.</p>
          <p>The Chinese organ trafficking goes against international law declared by the United Nations. According to the UN, it is a direct violation of human rights.</p>

          <h1>Evidence of Organ Trafficking</h1>
          <p>China is showing no signs of stopping this cruel practice on innocent people. They have made up false claims stating that they don't use this practice anymore, but this is highly controversial. The Chinese have recently been under fire by the Vatican by providing no evidence that they don't use this practice anymore. They only used a two slide presentation to display their cause, and many people believe that it's not enough. There has also been a book written in 2009 called Bloody Harvest, which goes into depth about these terrible killings. A phone conversation recorded states this</p>

        <div id="source">
          <h1>Source of Organs</h1>
          <p>The main source of these transplants are coming from Falun Gong. Falun Gong is a disciplinary centre teaching the Buddhist religion. China is prosecuting against them because they feel that they have too much power over the people living in China. The Chinese government feels that the people of Falun Gong can't be controlled by their propaganda. So, they have the need to kill these people and take their organs illegally without their, or a family member's consent. What China does is detain and capture these people into facilities. Then, they later kill them and use their organs to engage in Organ Trafficking.</p>
