                    <h3>Information About Organ Trafficking</h3>
                    <p>Organ trafficking is the illegal use, transportation, and gathering of human organs. In, China is a <em>billion</em> dollar business. Although it might generate lots of money for China, it is extremely cruel and harmful to everyone. Every year, China illegally carries out over 60,000 organ transplants. Most of these come from people who don't agree with China's political stance, or religion. These people are killed based on their beliefs and executed by the government and used for illegal organ transplants.</p>
                    <h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
                    <p>China is showing no signs of stopping this cruel practice on innocent people. They have made up false claims stating that they don't use this practice anymore, but this is highly controversial. The Chinese have recently been under fire by the Vatican by providing no evidence that they don't use this practice anymore. They only used a two slide presentation to display their cause, and many people believe that it's not enough. There has also been a book written in 2009 called Bloody Harvest, which goes into depth about these terrible killings. A phone conversation recorded states this:</p>

                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  The supply of organs we have, we have every day. We do them every day.</p>
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong>  We want fresh, live ones.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  They are all live, all live…</p>
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong>  I heard some come from those who practice Falun Gong, those who are very healthy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  Yes, we have. I can’t talk openly to you over the phone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong>  If you can find me this type, I am coming very soon.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  It’s OK. Please come.</p>

                    <h3>Where This Is Happening</h3>
                    <p>The main source of these transplants are coming from Falun Gong. Falun Gong is a disciplinary centre teaching the Buddhist religion. China is prosecuting against them because they feel that they have too much power over the people living in China. The Chinese government feels that the people of Falun Gong can't be controlled by their propaganda. So, they have the need to kill these people and take their organs illegally without their, or a family member's consent.</p>
