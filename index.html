                    <h3>Information About Organ Trafficking</h3>
                    <p>Organ trafficking is the illegal use, transportation, and gathering of human organs. In China,this is a 1 <em>billion</em> dollar business. Although it might generate lots of money for China, it is extremely cruel and harmful to everyone. Every year, China illegally carries out over 60,000 organ transplants. Most of these come from people who don't agree with China's political stance, or religion. These people are killed based on their beliefs and executed by the government and used for illegal organ transplants.</p>
                    <h3>Evidence of Organ Trafficking in China</h3> 
                    <p>There is lots of evidence to support the theory that China is engaging in this. A book published in 2009 called "Bloody Harvest", goes in- depth onn these killings. In the book, a phone call recorded states this:</p>
                    <div id="call">
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong>  I want to know how long [the patients] have to wait [for a liver transplant].</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  The supply of organs we have, we have every day. We do them every day.</p>
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong>  We want fresh, live ones.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  They are all live, all live…</p>
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong>  I heard some come from those who practice Falun Gong, those who are very healthy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  Yes, we have. I can’t talk openly to you over the phone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Caller:</strong>  If you can find me this type, I am coming very soon.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dr. Dai:</strong>  It’s OK. Please come.</p>
                        <p>This coverstation is between a chinese doctor and a unspecified caller. The doctor admits that he does organ transplants everyday, and gets them everyday. Later in the conversation, the doctor said that some of these are from Falun Gong Practioners. The only way they can get so many organs that fast, is by killing these people. Thats what their doing to these practioners. They get all of these organs from imprisoning and killing the Falun Gong practioners.</p>

                    <!--- Move this paragraph BEFORE the Evidence paragraph so people know what Falun Gong is when we present the evidence. --->
                    <h3>Where This Is Happening</h3>
                    <p>The main source of these transplants are coming from Falun Gong. Falun Gong is a disciplinary centre teaching the Buddhist religion. China is prosecuting against them because they feel that they have too much power over the people living in China. The Chinese government feels that the people of Falun Gong can't be controlled by their propaganda. So, they have the need to kill these people and take their organs illegally without their, or a family member's consent.</p>
